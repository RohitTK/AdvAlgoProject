# The 2-approximation for metric Steiner tree

"""
Algorithm Steps:

Step 1: For the given complete weighted graph input and set of required vertices,
        a MST needs to be found on the set of required vertices.
Step 2: MST Logic

Expected Input: A complete weighted graph (Satisfying triangle inequality) and a set of required vertices
Expected Output: Edge list of a Steiner Tree
