Input files present in the folder "Input files": weighted_graph.txt and required_vertices.txt

Steps to run:
To run the first algorithm:
-> Update the weighted_graph.txt where the first line is the number of vertices and every line after is a weighted edge
   in the format of u v w
-> Run Algorithm1.py
-> The returned output is

To run the second algorithm:
-> Update the weighted_graph.txt where the first line is the number of vertices and every line after is a weighted edge
   in the format of u v w
-> Update the required_vertices.txt which needs to contain the set of required vertices separated by space
-> Run Algorithm2.py
-> The returned output is

To run the third algorithm:
-> Update the weighted_graph.txt where the first line is the number of vertices and every line after is a weighted edge
   in the format of u v w
-> Update the required_vertices.txt which needs to contain the set of required vertices separated by space
-> Run Algorithm3.py
-> The returned output is

To run the fourth algorithm:
-> Update the weighted_graph.txt where the first line is the number of vertices and every line after is a weighted edge
   in the format of u v w
-> Update the required_vertices.txt which needs to contain the set of required vertices separated by space

-> The returned output is

To run the fifth algorithm:
-> Update the weighted_graph.txt where the first line is the number of vertices and every line after is a weighted edge
   in the format of u v w
